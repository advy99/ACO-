# ACO++

My implementation of an Ant Colony Optimization for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem plus a graphic representation using SDL2.

In this implementation i will use [Ant Colony System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/585892).

# WIP

This repo is still in heavy development and is my personal proyect for the 2021 summer, so don't expect this code to be the best or more complete you would expect.

(Also, PR are well received!)
